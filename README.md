# Support for Ukrainians in Austria

This page collects important and useful information for everyone who comes to Austria from Ukraine and for those who help them.  
Content will also be heavily be in german, as this is for Austria.

Always looking for more things to put on the list. Please open a PR or an issue!

## Contribute

You can easily contribute:
- Add or improve data in the `_data` directory. All info lives there.
- There is also room for improvement regarding the design and structure.

In general, you can just submit a PR. For bigger changes, please open an issue first to discuss the changes.
I'm also very open to granting maintainer rights for the actively involved.
